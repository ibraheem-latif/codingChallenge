// ----------------Additional notes----------------

// This code is a basic representation. In a real-world application, you would need error handling, 
// validation (like valid license plates), and possibly a database for persistence.

// Time is calculated based on the system's current time, which is simple but not always 
// accurate (e.g., in case of system time changes). In a production scenario, consider using a more 
// reliable time source.

// The synchronized keyword is used for simplicity. For higher concurrency, more sophisticated 
// concurrency controls like ReentrantReadWriteLock could be used.
